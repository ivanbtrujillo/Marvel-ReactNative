## Purpose
I've built this app after i started to learn react-native. This app it's just to learning react-native and at this moment it's only for IOS. The main objective is test many components.

If you have any doubt about how this code works, you can find me on twitter: [@ivanbtrujillo](https://twitter.com/ivanbtrujillo)

## Implemented components

I've used Navigator (not NavigatorIOS) to built the navigation across the entire app. 
Furthemore i've used the TouchableHighlight component to make the navigator.Navbar, allowing me to construct the back button and set it's background.

On the main screen (after the Login Screen), i've used a TabBarIOS component to make some tabs. To add custom icons, i've imported the react-native-vector-icons library: [Icon library](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons)

To display all the comics that i've obtained from the marvel API, i've used the ListView component.
